	  This is our Hangman project that my group did. The program selects words randomly from a preset word bank with the goal of guessing the correct word before the body of he person gets compleltely drawn. If the player guesses a letter or word incorrectly, thgen the program draws a body partuntil the entire figure is drawn. ay incorrect guesses are put into the letter bank bellow the spaces.
